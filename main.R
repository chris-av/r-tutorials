# see each folder for individualized tutorials on how to do certain tasks

# files prepended with 000_ mean that they are useful information to the topic at hand
# other files are prepended with 001_, 002_,
#    for these, I tried organizing the files from easiest/basic to hardest/complex
# BEWARE: be mindful of what libraries you have on your computer
#    for instance, library(stargazer) implicitly assumes that at some point,
#    you downloaded the stargazer package using install.packages("stargazer")
