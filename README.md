# R Tutorials

This is a repo that I created for myself for learning how to do things in R. Each folder is like a vignette that demonstrates a concept or certain task.

Some of the data that I use for demonstration comes from *Principles of Economics*


[git@github.com:ccolonescu/PoEdata.git](This) repository shows how to access the data as a R library. Use it for reference if you encounter any issues with the `PoE` library.
